			<p>This is not a real restaurant. It's just a thing I'm doing for the Software Guild intro coding course. But like, how cool would it be if we could make burgers on our computer? That would be so freaking awesome! They say "you wouldn't download a burger"... heck yes I would download a burger. I'd sit there programming food to print out on a 3D printer all dang day. Just give me the code for some delicious fries and I'm in. Anyway, here's a website.</p>
